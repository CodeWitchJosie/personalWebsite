I am Jocelyn Irwin and I have been in the industry since 2007. My passion lies in solving human-centric problems, from creating user-friendly interfaces to streamlining development processes to writing clean, maintainable code. I thrive on fostering collaborative team cultures where work is not just a task but an enjoyable experience.

Over the years, I've handled the full software development cycle—building rapid prototypes, transforming them into production-ready software, and maintaining existing systems. I've led agile teams in fast-paced environments, ensuring efficiency under tight deadlines.

Experienced in Lean product development and agile practices, I excel in requirements gathering and translating ideas into practical software. My technical toolkit is focused in TypeScript and React, but I'm very interested in exploring Vue.js. While I've explored mobile app development using NativeScript, my heart remains in web development.

I am always eager to share my experiences and lessons learned. I'm open to technical talks within our local community. If you're organizing an event, reach out with the details—let's discuss the when, where, and the topic. I'm here to connect, share knowledge, and contribute to our collective growth!
